Structure of a Prompt for AI Coding
Task Description
Clearly state what you want the AI to do. Be specific about the functionality and purpose of the code.
Programming Language
Specify the programming language you want the code to be written in (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java).
Input and Output
Describe the expected input and output of the code. Include data types and formats if applicable.
Constraints and Requirements
List any constraints, such as performance requirements, specific libraries or frameworks to use, or coding standards to follow.
Example Use Cases
Provide example inputs and expected outputs to illustrate how the code should work.
Additional Context
Include any additional context or background information that might be relevant to the task.
Example Prompt
Hereâ€™s an example of a detailed prompt for an AI coding task:
Task Description:
I need a function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number n. The function should return a list of Fibonacci numbers up to n.
Programming Language:
Python
Input and Output:
Input: An integer n representing the upper limit for the Fibonacci sequence.
Output: A list of Fibonacci numbers up to n.
Constraints and Requirements:
The function should be efficient and handle large values of n.
Use a recursive approach with memoization to optimize performance.
Include error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., negative numbers).
Example Use Cases:
Input: n = 10
Expected Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
Input: n = 1
Expected Output: [0, 1]
Additional Context:
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence should be generated up to but not exceeding the given number n.
Detailed Breakdown of the Example Prompt
Task Description
Clearly states the goal: to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number n.
Programming Language
Specifies Python as the required language.
Input and Output
Describes the expected input (an integer n) and output (a list of Fibonacci numbers).
Constraints and Requirements
Mentions the need for efficiency and the use of a recursive approach with memoization.
Includes error handling for invalid inputs.
Example Use Cases
Provides two examples with inputs and expected outputs to illustrate the expected behavior.
Additional Context
Offers a brief explanation of the Fibonacci sequence to provide context.
